DAT2WAV - What is it?
----------------------

DAT2WAV is a simple little command line program to dump the digital
audio from a DAT tape to a wav file, and write audio data to a DAT tape.  
It runs only in a DOS window under Win95/98/Me/NT/2K/XP. It requires the ASPI 
drivers to be installed and running.

This new version of DAT2WAV includes the ability to use MP3 source files
when writing to tape.  We had hoped to be able to include a fully licensed
MP3 decoder to ship with the software, but it turned out that we had
some problems getting the patent license from Thomson. These problems caused
a very long delay in being able to release our software and even prevented
us from completing our beta testing. For the actual MP3 decoding, we have no 
choice but to use the decoder that ships with Windows 98 and later.  It also 
ships with Microsoft's Netmeeting and Direct X.  This means that most users
should already have the decoder installed.  The driver file will be called
l3codeca.acm, l3codecp.acm or l3codecx.acm and should be hiding somewhere in
the windows directory or its subdirectories.
If you can't find any of them on your machine, you can try to get l3codecx.acm from: 
http://soundamerica.com/codec.htm

In order for this software to work you have to have the ARCHIVE or
Sony DAT drives with the audio firmware.  The software does check 
for the firmware, and will fail if it isn't there. See notes at end 
of this text file for more info on the drives.

The version being distributed is limited to extracting or writing the 
audio for only 5 minutes of the tape.  This should be enough for you
to decide if the software will work for you before ordering it.
The full registered version has no such limit.

What's new in 1.2?
------------------
We've added a LOT of new features in 1.2.  The biggest new feature is
the ability to write DAT tapes. A summary of the new features:
 - WAV2DAT - write WAV and MP3 files to tape
 - DAT2DAT - use two drives to make an exact copy of a tape
 - DAT2IMG - make a copy of a tape to an image file
 - IMG2DAT - write an image file to tape
 - Media Recognition System (MRS) support
 - seek to specific points on tape before reading
 - force reading tape to physical end of tape
 - user settable lead-in, lead-out, intertrack silence gaps
 - repair most types of read errors
 - a whole lot more code to help diagnose problems

What's new in 1.1?
------------------
DAT2WAV now supports DAT tapes that have 48KHz, 44.2KHz, 32KHz 
and 32KHz LP modes.  It also has quite a lot more code to deal
with all the strange things our customers were seeing at the
early parts of a tape that have been recorded on a number of
times before.  We've made great improvements to the waveout
functions so that they work very well on slower machines with
slower drives. We've also spent a lot of time working with 
Sony to make sure the software fully supports their audio
enabled DAT drive.

How do I use this program?
--------------------------


It uses a simple command line interface to specify all the parameters.

You have to specify a mode (one of DAT2WAV, WAV2DAT, DAT2DAT, DAT2IMG, IMG2DAT),
as well as the host adapter number and the scsi id of the tape drive.


Mode types:
/DAT2WAV FILENAME - the mode to extract the audio to wav files using the
                    filename FILENAME as the base for each of the files written
                    to disk.  When using /STARTID, each file will be given a
                    sequential name starting with 01. eg. FILENAME01.WAV
/WAV2DAT CUEFILE - the mode to write a number of files to tape using the file
                   called CUEFILE.CUE.  The software will automatically add
                   the .CUE to the file name so no file extension should be used.
/DAT2IMG IMGFILE - the mode to copy an entire tape to disk as a single image file
                   called IMGFILE
/IMG2DAT IMGFILE - the mode to copy a single image file to tape using the file
                   called IMGFILE
/DAT2DAT - the mode to copy an entire tape directly to another tape when using
           two tape drives

Tape drive specification:
/INPUTID HostAdapter:TargetID - when using DAT2WAV, DAT2IMG, and DAT2DAT you have
                    to define the ASPI host adapter number and SCSI target ID
/OUTPUTID HostAdapter:TargetID - when using WAV2DAT, IMG2DAT, and DAT2DAT you have
                    to define the ASPI host adapter number and SCSI target ID

The host adapter number is the one assigned by the ASPI drivers.  The target id
is the actual SCSI id of the tape drive. If you don't know what these values are
for your system, you may be helped by getting the program ID.EXE from www.grc.com.

Optional settings:
/WAVEOUT - specify to send the audio to the soundcard instead of a wave file
/REWIND - specify if you want the tape to be rewound before starting.
/STARTID - specify if you want the wav files created to be split when
           start id's are found on the tape - not specifying this option
           will only change wav files when a new sample rate is found
/MRSOFF - the Archive 4326/8000 drives have a feature to detect if a tape is
          audio vs DDS and will prevent writing to audio tapes without setting
          the MRS mode to off.  This is done by the software automatically, but
          can be ignored if necessary
/STOPEOT - the software normally uses the end of tape markers to identify when to
           stop reading.  Some times there are all kinds of wierd things written
           to the tape that can confuse the software.  One case is when a tape has
           been recorded a whole bunch of times.  By using the /STOPEOT option the
           software will only stop reading when the physical end of tape is reached.
/SEEK - allows seeking to a specific point on the tape before writing.  The position 
        can be defined by:
	   Program number (PROGNUM)
	   Absolute time (ABSTIME)
	   Running time (RUNTIME)
	   Program time (PROGTIME)
 	The PROGNUM is just the integer number of the program number
	The other times are defined in the form of HH:MM:SS:FF

/ERRORCORRECT - this turns on error correction of read errors from the
          tape. The errors are only corrected when the drive reports that
          it has encountered problems with a particular frame. There 
          tend to be many more errors at the points in the tape where
          the DAT recorder has been either paused or stopped.

Here's a whole bunch of examples of how to use the varous options

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc, only changing wav files
 when a new sample rate is found

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /rewind
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - this will rewind the
 tape before extracting the audio - will change wav files only when
 a new sample rate is found

DAT2WAV /dat2wav /inputid 1:5 /waveout
 this will play the audio to the sound card instead of writing to disk

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found

DAT2WAV /wav2dat CUEFILE /outputid 1:5 /rewind
 this will write to tape a number of files based on the cuefile.cue file. It will
 also rewind the tape prior to writing

DAT2WAV /dat2dat /inputid 1:5 /outputid 1:6 
 this will copy a tape from 1:5 to 1:6

DAT2WAV /dat2img IMGFILE /inputid 1:5 /rewind
 this will copy an entire tape from 1:5 to a file called IMGFILE

DAT2WAV /img2dat IMGFILE /outputid 1:5 /rewind
 this will copy to tape 1:5 from a tape image file called IMGFILE

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid /seek PROGNUM 4
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found - it will seek to
 the start of Program Number 4 before starting to read data

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid /seek ABSTIME 02:15:22:07
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found - it will seek to
 the Absolute time 2h15m22s07f

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid /seek RUNTIME 02:15:22:07
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found - it will seek to
 the Running time 2h15m22s07f

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid /seek PROGTIME 02:15:22:07
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found - it will seek to
 the Program time 2h15m22s07f

DAT2WAV /wav2dat CUEFILE /outputid 1:5 /rewind /mrsoff
 this will write to tape a number of files based on the cuefile.cue file - it will
 rewind the tape prior to writing - it will not turn off the Media Recognition System
 on 4326/8000 drives when real audio DAT tapes are used (normally MRS is configured
 in the drive automatically by DAT2WAV)

DAT2WAV /dat2wav dataud /inputid 1:5 /startid /stopeot
 this will dump from tape drive at 1:5 to wav files called
 dataud1.wav, dataud2.wav, dataud3.wav etc - it will change wav files
 when either a new sample rate or a start id is found - it will read from the
 tape until the physical end of tape is reached instead of stopping at the logical
 end of tape



Cuefile structure
-----------------
The cuefile is comprised of two parts, the configuration section and 
the track list section.

SCMS - this allows setting what SCMS bits should be written to the tape
	00 - copy permit
	01 - one copy remaining
	10 - copy prohibit
	11 - reserved

STARTID - ON/OFF - write start ids for each track
ABS_TIME - ON/OFF - write the Absolute Time (ABSTIME) to the tape
PROGRAM_NUMBER - ON/OFF - write the program numbers for each track
32KHZ_LP = ON/OFF - write the 32khz tracks in long play mode - the software will
                   not do the sample rate conversion from either 44.1khz or 48khz
LEADIN_SILENCE - write x number of seconds to the start of the tape
LEADOUT_SILENCE - write x number of seconds to the end of the tape
INTERTRACK_SILENCE - write x number of seconds between the tracks of the tape (written
                    as silence at the end of each track)

FILE - this identifies each of the file names to be written to the tape
  each entry needs to identify the track number and needs to be 3 characters
  used for each number eg. FILE_001, FILE_002, FILE_003
  each file can be any of the following types:
    - 32khz 16bit stereo WAV
    - 44.1khz 16bit stereo WAV
    - 48khz 16bit stereo WAV
    - 32khz 16bit stereo MP3
    - 44.1khz 16bit stereo MP3
    - 48khz 16bit stereo MP3



Here's an example of the contents of a good cuefile:
[CONFIG]
SCMS=00
STARTID=ON
ABS_TIME=ON
PROGRAM_NUMBER=ON
32KHZ_LP=OFF
LEADIN_SILENCE=10
LEADOUT_SILENCE=10
INTERTRACK_SILENCE=10
[FILES]
FILE_001=d:\music\All you need is love.mp3
FILE_002=d:\music\A hard day's night.mp3
FILE_003=d:\music\track03.wav




What drives work with it?
-------------------------

So far the list of drive/firmware combinations that apparently work are: 

labeled Archive 4320NT: 
   ARCHIVE Python 25601-XXX2.63 (we've tested one)
   ARCHIVE Python 25601-XXX2.75 (we've tested one)

labeled Archive 4330: 
   ARCHIVE Python 25601-XXX2.63 (we've tested one)

labeled Conner/Seagate CTD-8000/4326NT: 
   ARCHIVE Python 01931-XXX5AC (we've tested one)
   ARCHIVE Python 01931-XXX5.56 (haven't actually had one in hand) 
   ARCHIVE Python 01931-XXX5.63 (haven't actually had one in hand) 

labeled Conner 4530:
   ARCHIVE Python 25501-XXX (haven't actually had one in hand) 

labeled Sony SDT-9000:
   SONY    SDT-9000    1.11 (haven't actually had one in hand)
   SONY    SDT-9000    1.13 (we've tested one)
           (SGI sells the Sony drives under the part numbers: P9-DAT12-INT (internal) 
           and P9-DAT7-EXT (external) )

A lot of useful information is available from our DAT FAQ web page:

What's involved in registering the software?
--------------------------------------------

We've thought long and hard about what to do about registration.  We
know that you can buy the $2500 drive from SGI and use their software 
for who knows how much money, we also know you can spend $2500 and buy
the software/hardware solution for the MAC.  We think there is a
market for a much less expensive solution.  We will be working hard to
find distributors who have the necessary drives and we will be letting
everyone know what to do to order them.  We will also be looking into
doing bulk purchases of the drives to see if there are any price
improvements.

As for price, we think you don't have to spend thousands of dollars,
and as with all our software we price it reasonably.  The registration 
fee for DAT2WAV is $50 US.  We won't be asking for a fee every time a new 
version comes out. The fee will give you a lifetime (or as long as we 
bug fix and add features) of free updates via the Internet.  We will 
also notify registered users by email of any new versions for a year.

Our partner company Wellesworth Publishing has been licensed to sell
the software to customers who wish to use credit cards.
