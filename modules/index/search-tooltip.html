<div class="text-left">
  <p>Enter a search string to find messages whose author, subject, and body
    contain contain all of the given words.</p>

  <p>The following operators are supported:
  <ul>
    <li><b>from:name</b> - show only messages whose author contains the given name</li>
    <li><b>subject:"some words"</b> - show only messages whose subject contains the given words</li>
    <li><b>body:"some words"</b> - show only messages whose body contains the given words</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Note that exact matches are not supported yet. For example, a search for "very serendipitous"
    in quotes will still return results where the words occur separately in the message,
    along with variations like "serendipitously"</p>
