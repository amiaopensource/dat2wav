                                              DAT Audio                                ROUGH AS GUTS DEVELOPMENT VERSION!                               Written by Andrew Longhorn (Manager@ImagineIT.com.au)        **************** WARNING **********************THIS PROGRAM IS A VERY EARLY VERSION PROOF OF TECHNOLOGY RELEASE.It is provided completely free of charge, riddled with bugs, half-implemented tests and debug code galore.The purpose of this release is to let people who intend to use dat-audio devices try the software to see if their drive is audio-capable and get some feedback on people's success with various machines/hardware and audio media.KNOWN BUGS:MANY:1) Many features do not work.2) Interface is clunky3) Support for Virtual Memory not implemented, must run with VM turned OFF.4) Possible "sticky" audio setting. If drive fails to function after using this program, rerun the program to re-init the drive and then quit to reset it.5) DAT format is hardwired to 48K stereo. It is expected other recording formats will have no success during playback/record.6) Playback "skips" - minor bug in buffered read/write causes a glitch in playback.7) GOTO timecode feature: text input is not error-checked, use this with caution, but it should locate to given timecode successfully.8) MASSIVE playback debugging output. During playback, the debug log is buffered to memory, this is then dumped to the window when play is stopped. Be careful not to let the tape "play" too long or you will be in for a massive wait for the debug to finish writing to screen.9) NOT BULLET-TESTED. Beware this is tested only on a G3 souped 7500 with an Archive Python drive chipped for audio.MY REQUEST:This is provided to the public domain in return for feedback. I need to know the important things to fix and include for the first release. Answering these questions in an email to Manager@ImagineIT.com.au would be invaluable to the development effort:1) Is SDII the best export format, AIFF is almost implemented, is that enough for v1.0? Is it ok simply to export to the audio file in the same sampling initially?2) Of course I'll fix the interface, but what is the way you want to navigate? Do you specify a timecode/program? or do you skip and listen? Is a scroller a good idea?3) What formats do you record in? 48K mono? Multi-channel? or is everyone on 48K stereo?Any other suggestions.HARDWARE REQUIREMENTSTo make use of this software you will need an Audio capable SCSI DAT drive connected to your computer. The software drives the dat drive directly, so no additional drivers, inits, cdevs, whatever are required.Currently, only the Conner 4320's with Firmware revision 2.75 support Audio over SCSI.If anyone has another dat drive that supposedly supports audio over scsi, please notify meif the DAT Audio program does not work.INSTALLATIONPlace the DAT Audio application where you want it.:)OPERATIONThe basic steps are to:¥ select a tape device from the DAT menu (if the device doesn't show up, make sure it is on and a tape is loaded, then select RESCAN SCSI from the DAT menu. If that doesn't work, you're stuffed).¥ position the tape using the tape controls in the controls menu or the controls floating window. <- currently only the time location menu option is coded and can be tested.¥ record the tape to your hard disk by selecting Record from the controls menu, specifying the amount to record and a target file. <- maybe not! :)¥ rewind and eject are implemented.TO DO¥ DAT seek program functionality¥ auto-detect new tapes and show current location automatically.¥ Correct buffer management to allow precision placement of the tape¥ Allow DAT->SDII recording.¥ provide gui interface for positioning¥ additional controls? info?¥ Nifty control panel with tape counter, control buttons and levels.******* First release should occur at this point.¥ user specifyable destination file type and creator.¥ Integrated EQ to allow digital EQ of a sound while it is being transferred to disk.   including nice sliders and real-time spectral analysis.¥ DAT recording ability, allow writing of AIFF files to DAT Audio format.¥ Implement the technology as a sound input device and associated scsi dat control face so a scsi dat drive can be used for real-time audio playback similar to the existing apple cd interface and drivers.
